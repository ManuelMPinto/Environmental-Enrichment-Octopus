# Effect of Environmental Enrichment in *Octopus vulgaris'* behaviour

My bachelor's end of degree project was finished and presented in September 2023. All the data presented was collected, cleaned and visualized by me with the help of my supervisor. The idea to add it to my github portfolio has been a long time coming and its finally here. However at the time it was done in Portuguese so I'm currently in the process of translating it. I've translated the results and presented the graphs and descriptions, further information about each will be added in the next weeks and a proper introduction to the whole project, theory and conclusions.

## **Disclaimer: The results presented lack number of studied individuals and observation sessions to be considered scientific proof of whatever conclusions are presented.**

# Abstract
Animal welfare is of growing concern in the context of captivity in public aquariums for both institutions and visitors. To make up for the limitations of captivity and monotony, environmental enrichment has been a way to stimulate animals and reduce their stress.
In the present study, an enrichment plan was implemented for the common octopus kept at SEALIFE Porto aquarium. A total of 6 objects were used, divided into 3 groups and added in pairs in order to determine their preference of use between one another. They were added following a predefined schedule to avoid habituation, with a varied time of day to see if it had an influence on the effectiveness of the enrichment.
The results show that enrichment decreases rest, especially reclusive rest, and increases activity and interaction with objects in the subject observed. It was found that enrichment in the morning seems to be more effective. It was also possible to identify some object preferences.
Enrichment seems to have a positive impact on the well-being of the octopus at SEALIFE. 

**Key words:** *Environmental enrichment; animal welfare; public aquarium; octopus; behavior.*

|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rest        | Bentonic Rest (DB)       | Arms folded radially around/under the head. Head lowered, constant independent movement of the tip of the arms.                                     |
| Rest        |  Altered Rest (DA)       | Similar to DB, rear arms fixed to the glass with suction cups, head resting against the glass, front of the head facing the inside of the aquarium. |
| Rest        | Rest  on Rock (DR)       | Perched on the rocks, with radially distributed arms, relatively far apart ‘hugging’ the rock.                                                      |
| Rest        | Weird Rest (DE)          | One arm pinned to the ground, stretched out, the rest of the body similar to DB but clinging to the suspended glass.                                |
| Rest        | "Human" Rest   (DH)      | Eight arms joined together, extended and rests on their tips.                                                                                       |
| Rest        | Suspended Rest (DS)      | Similar to DR but it takes place between rocks and the body is suspended by the arms.                                                               |
| Rest        | Sleeping (D)             | Inside the burrow, arms folded, fixed to the floor, wall and ceiling. Eyes half-closed and total absence of arm movement.                           |
| Locomotion  | Jet Swim (NJ)            | Fast swimming using the siphon for propulsion. Arms extended parallel to the body.                                                                  |
| Locomotion  | Strok Swim (NB)          | Uncertain if siphon is used, arms move in a similar way to arm strokes and move in a similar way to NJ.                                             |
| Locomotion  | Crawl (R)                | Most common form of locomotion, moving in a DB-like position on the bottom of the aquarium.                                                         |
| Locomotion  | Climb/Altered Crawl (RA) | It's the same as R, but it's attached to the glass and there are two loose front suspended arms.                                                    |
| Locomotion  | Fall (Q)                 | It occurs after swimming, crawling across the glass or going to the surface, free-falling to the bottom with arms distributed radially.             |
| Defensive   | Isolation (I)            | Defensive position, completely inside the burrow, arms folded up to cover the head and eyes, leaving only the beak and one eye uncovered.           |
| Defensive   | Push                     | Uses one of his arms to push an adverse stimulus away from him.                                                                                     |
| Defensive   | Paint (P)                | Releases paint through the siphon, accompanied by NJ.                                                                                               |
| Maintenance | Self-Cleaning (L)        | Arms folded over head, eyes half closed, sliding movement of arms along head/eyes. Usually, food remains are expelled.                              |
| Maintenance | Burrow Cleaning (LT)     | The octopus is inside the burrow in Rest position and moves the substrate stones away with its arms.                                                |
| Interaction | Grab (1)                 | One or more arms exploring the item, suction cups manipulating the item.                                                                            |
| Interaction | Hug (2)                  | Several arms in interacting, item wrapped in the cloak.                                                                                             |
| Interaction | Rest on Object (DO)      | Octopus perched on the object while manipulating it.                                                                                                |
| Interaction | Transporting (T)         | Octopus perched on the object while manipulating it.                                                                                                |
